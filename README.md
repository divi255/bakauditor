# bakauditor - Backup Auditor

## What is this

**bakauditor** is an automatic backup auditor robot.

All of us have backups. Every day something is backing up on background of our
desktops and somewhere on our servers. But what if backup has been failed and
you haven't even received an alert about it? Probably you'll find you miss
important backups only when your system is crashed and you need them.

People, who faced this problem at least once in a life, usually manually audit
their backups from time to time. That's why I've decided to automate this
boring stuff once and forever and created **bakauditor**.

## What can it do

Currently, **bakauditor** supports backup audit via plugins:

* **file** check backup, stored in file (modification time, min. size etc.)

* **dir** get most recent file in directory and check it like **file** does

* **zfs** check if ZFS snapshots exists on local or remote system

* **borg** borg backup repositories, local or remote

## How to use

Just run

```shell
bakauditor
```

and it will show you list of all your backups and their status.

You may also run

```shell
bakauditor -x
```

In this case, only failed backups are printed, otherwise you get a message:

```
Checked: 14, failed: 0

All backups are fine
```

**bakauditor** process exits with code *0* when everything is fine, and with
error codes when something is wrong. So you may just get its output and send
via e-mail or what you prefer when something is wrong. And e.g. weekly receive
output even if everything is fine, to check **bakauditor** is running and all
your backups are safe.

## Installation

```shell
pip3 install bakauditor
```

## Configuration

Put configuration file to */usr/local/etc/bakauditor.yml*. This is YAML file
and it has the following sections.

### default section

```yaml
default:
    time: 2d
    min-size: 10000000
```

Options in this section apply to all backup configurations, unless overriden.

### file

Example:

```yaml
server1:
    type: file
    path: /export/backups/server1/server1.dump.gz
    time: 3d
    min-size: 10000000
```

In the above example, we ask **bakauditor** to check backup stored in the
specified file, the file should not be older than 3 days and have a minimal
size of 10 megabytes to be considered as good backup.

Options *time* and *min-size* are optional if specified in *default* section.

### directory

Example:

```yaml
server1:
    type: dir
    path: /export/backups/server1
    time: 3d
    min-size: 10000000
```

This example will to the same as previous, but automatically get the most
recent file in the specified directory and check it. Good, when you do e.g.
incremental backups.

### zfs

Example:

```yaml
server1:
    type: zfs
    time-fmt: "snapshot-%Y-%m%-%d-%H:%M:%S"
    fs: bakpool/server1
```

Option *time-fmt* is used to get snapshot creation time from snapshot name.  We
can not determine when ZFS snapshot has been created (unless we perform *zfs
get creation* for every snapshot, which could be pretty slow), but if snapshot
name contains time, we can decode it and check.

Option *fs* specifies file system, where snapshots are located.

Optionally, you may ask **bakauditor** to analyze ZFS snapshot on remote server
via ssh, specifying *ssh* option:

```yaml
server1:
    type: zfs
    time-fmt: "snapshot-%Y-%m%-%d-%H:%M:%S"
    fs: bakpool/server1
    ssh: root@192.168.1.77
```

This option is just converted to command *ssh <option_value> zfs list ...* so
you may specify any options for ssh program you like.

Note: *min-size* option for zfs snapshots is ignored.

### borg

Example:

```yaml
borg-local:
  type: borg
  repo: /bak
  password: 123
```

To check repo on remote system, add "ssh" option.

Note: plugin requires **borg** >= 1.1.0, for older version use *borg0* instead
(doesn't check backup size).
